        <p>Maybe won't you take it back
            Say you were tryna make me laugh
            And nothing has to change today
            You didn't mean to say "I love you"
            I love you and I don't want to
            
            Up all night on another red eye
            I wish we never learned to fly
            I-I-I
            Maybe we should just try
            To tell ourselves a good lie
            I didn't mean to make you cry
            The smile that you gave me
            Even when you felt like dying
            We fall apart as it gets dark
            I'm in your arms in Central Park
            There's nothing you could do or say
            I can't escape the way, I love you
            I don't want to, but I love you</p>
