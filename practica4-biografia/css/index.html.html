                <p>Don't you call him baby
                    We're not talking lately
                    Don't you call him what you used to call me
                    I, I confess I can tell that you are at your best
                    I'm selfish so I'm hating it
                    I noticed that there's a piece of you in how I dress
                    Take it as a compliment
                    Don't you call him baby
                    We're not talking lately
                    Don't you call him what you used to call me
                    I, I just miss
                    I just miss your accent and your friends
                    Did you know I still talk to them?
                    Does he take you walking round his parents' gallery?</p>
