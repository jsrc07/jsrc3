        <p>What do you want from me?
        Why don't you run from me?
        What are you wondering?
        What do you know?

        Why do you care for me?
        When we all fall asleep, where do we go?
        Come here...
        Say it, spit it out
        What is it exactly you're paying?
        Is the amount cleanin' you out?
        Am I satisfactory?
        Today, I'm thinkin' about
        The things that are deadly
        The way I'm drinkin' you down
        Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me
        Step on the glass, staple your tongue (ahh)
        Bury a friend, try to wake up (ahh)
        Cannibal class, killin' the son (ahh)
        Bury a friend, I wanna end me</p>
